# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2020

### Day 1: 23 May

**Today's Progress**: worked on freeCodeCamp's API and microservices certification

**Thoughts**: I felt pretty good about this. I discovered Glitch and I like that it's so much faster than setting up a Node project manually. The courses were mainly a reminder, not sure if it was worth it to take notes. Projects were straighforward, what took a while was figuring out how to deal with invalid dates.

### Day 2: 24 May

**Today's Progress**: I set up a MongoDB database, did the first two Mongoose challenges then started work on the URL shortener project.

**Thoughts**: I got really frustrated by the vagueness of the assignments in the Mongoose chapter so switched to a project for a change but then wasted time working out why tests passed automatically. Shame on freeCodeCamp, if those tests don't work they shouldn't be there at all.

### Day 3: 25 May

**Today's Progress**: I implemented a naive version of the create short url use case based on `_id`.

**Thoughts**: At 24 characters, `_id` is too long for a short url. I need to implement something better. But at least it deals with the database and it returns a json object as per the specs.
