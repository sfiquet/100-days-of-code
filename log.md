# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2020

### Day 1: 23 May

**Today's Progress**: worked on freeCodeCamp's API and microservices certification

**Thoughts:** I felt pretty good about this. I discovered Glitch and I like that it's so much faster than setting up a Node project manually. The courses were mainly a reminder, not sure if it was worth it to take notes. Projects were straighforward, what took a while was figuring out how to deal with invalid dates.
